Ecoverse – Pan-India Smart Irrigation System

Problem Statement:
Inefficient irrigation practices in agriculture lead to water wastage and crop stress.
Language barriers also prevent farmers from effectively using digital decision-support tools.

Solution:
A multilingual, AI-assisted smart irrigation decision support system that provides
irrigation recommendations based on soil and environmental parameters.

Key Features:
- Pan-India coverage with state-specific crops
- Multilingual interface supporting Indian regional languages
- Manual simulation of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
- AI-based irrigation prediction using a trained model
- Batch upload and irrigation history tracking

Tech Stack:
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest)

How to Run:
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn

2. Run the application:
   streamlit run app.py

Review-3 Notes:
- This is a software prototype developed for hackathon evaluation
- The ML model is trained on sample/synthetic data for demonstration
- Manual simulation represents future IoT sensor inputs
- The system architecture is scalable for real-time ML and hardware integration
