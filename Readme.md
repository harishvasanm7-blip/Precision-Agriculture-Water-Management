# Precision Agriculture – Water Management System

## Track
Data Science & Machine Learning (Environmental / SDGs)

## Problem Statement
Agriculture consumes a major share of freshwater resources. Traditional irrigation practices rely on fixed schedules, leading to inefficient water usage and water wastage.

## Proposed Solution
A data-driven irrigation recommendation system that analyses soil moisture and weather parameters to predict optimal irrigation requirements using machine learning.

 Approach
- Data preprocessing using pandas
- Machine learning-based irrigation prediction
- Streamlit-based web interface for demonstration

 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Current Status
- GitHub repository created
- Basic Streamlit interface implemented
- Dataset identified
- ML model pipeline under development

## Future Scope
- Integration with real-time IoT sensors
- Mobile application for farmers
